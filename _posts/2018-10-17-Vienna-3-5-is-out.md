We are pleased to announce that Vienna 3.5 is out. It improves on many things, but the most visible feature is the support of macOS Mojave (10.14) ‘s dark mode appearance.

This version will probably be the latest to run on OS X Mavericks (10.9). We need to go forward to include some much needed improvements.

By the way, since the release of version 3.0 about 4 years ago, Vienna’s codebase has received on average 1.12 commit per day.

We hope you enjoy reading your feeds on Vienna!
