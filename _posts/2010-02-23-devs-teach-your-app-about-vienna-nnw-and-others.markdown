<p>Just as a quick reminder: Vienna, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> and probably a few other apps implement <a href="http://www.inessential.com">Brent Simmon's</a> excellent and useful <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/developers/externalinterface">External Weblog Editor Interface</a>. If you implement the receiving portion of this protocol, we can send you information about posts, websites, etc. which you can then re-use in your application. </p>
<p>Vienna even has a facility for creating plugins (with toolbar buttons and menu entries) that make this process a one-click affair for your users. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to ask on the <a href="https://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18">Developer Forum</a>. Applications that already implement this include Cocoalicious, Pukka, Ecto, MarsEdit, etc...</p>
