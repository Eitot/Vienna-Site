<p><em>UPDATED Jan 2nd 2012  : download link has been updated and refers to 3.0.0 Beta 8</em></p>
<p>Since I transferred <a href="https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss">Vienna's development to GitHub</a>, we have been getting lots and lots of great contributions to the project. Chief among new contributors are <a href="http://ansani.it/">Salvatore Ansani</a> and <a href="http://blog.barijaona.com/">Barijaona Ramaholimihaso</a>. Their work has led to a new release of Vienna, which you can now download here:</p>
<h2><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/TestVersions/3.0.0_beta8/Vienna3.0.0_beta8.tgz/download">Download Vienna 3 BETA</a></h2><br />
They have been working on a slew of bug-fixes and improvements (Google Reader support!) that you can now find in Vienna 3 BETA:</p>
