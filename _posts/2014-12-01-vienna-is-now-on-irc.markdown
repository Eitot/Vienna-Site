<p>To all those who wish to participate in a lively discussion about all things Vienna related (past, present, and future!), you can now find the #ViennaRSS (no, that isn't a hashtag!) channel on the freenode IRC network (chat.freenode.net).</p>
<p>If you don't have an IRC client handy, you can try <a href="http:&#47;&#47;colloquy.info&#47;">Colloquy<&#47;a> or the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;webchat.freenode.net&#47;" target="_blank">freenode webchat client<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I hope to see you all there! </p>
