<p>We are very happy to present <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/latest/download">Vienna 3 Beta 12</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement of the end of Google Reader was indeed a shock ; but it also opened to talented developers and entrepreneurs a new range of opportunities for presenting some alternatives. For Vienna users, the end result should be more choice.</p>
<p>Vienna started as a standalone RSS reader. It is still perfectly able to be used this way.</p>
<p>But in a world where the use of portable devices is frequent, total or partial synchronisation of reading lists was a much needed feature. Now, we are able to indicate  to Vienna’s users at least three working solutions : </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bazqux.com">Bazqux</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feedhq.org">FeedHQ</a></li>
<li>any instance of FeedHQ running in the hosting environment of your choice (FeedHQ is an <a href="https://github.com/feedhq/feedhq">open source project</a>).</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Other services might work too, now or in the near future. We chose to support what is called the <a href="http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/rssconsensus/">Open Reader API</a>, which is best summarized by <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader">this post by Marco Arment</a>. Bazqux and FeedHQ were considered a priority, because the commitment of their teams to this openness approach was clear. And they were very supportive of our efforts, providing ideas for current and future developments.</p>
<p>We will probably be able to add support of The Old Reader a little later. Feedly support might follow one day, but this is not yet a commitment, as a documentation review has yet to be done…</p>
<p>For mobile devices, we currently know of two applications which both support Bazqux and  FeedHQ : </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8">Mr. Reader</a> (iPad only)</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/feeddler-rss-reader-pro/id365710282?mt=8">Feeddler Pro</a>.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Please, note that we haven’t tested these iOS apps ourselves. Other solutions will probably emerge.</p>
<p>There are other changes in Vienna Beta 12. Here are the most important : </p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed our layouts : Horizontal, Vertical and Unified</li>
<li>The Unified layout has been completely rewritten. It now allows selection of an article (by use of a right click or a click in the left margin) for sharing it or marking it.</li>
<li>Vienna’s integrated browser is now able to present the user a file selection dialog (for instance for uploading a file)</li>
<li>Added a “Reindex Database” menu item</li>
<li>Fix problems with icons in Leopard and Snow Leopard</li>
<li>Visual tweaks and improvements</li>
<li>Translation improvements (Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, German, French, Korean)</li>
<li>Many bugfixes</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>And please, if you have been an user of Vienna for a while, take a minute to answer <a href="http://cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?t=26269&p=137020">this poll on keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
