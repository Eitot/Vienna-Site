Hi Everyone!

Welcome to the first bit of news for Vienna in 2017.

Firstly, we have changed our main website URL to [www.vienna-rss.com](http://www.vienna-rss.com). Please change any bookmarks you may have as we are no longer using the .org URL. We are working on a new website design which we hope to have ready within the next month.

Vienna 3.1.9 has also been released â€“ this is a minor release but it fixes some important bugs. It will also upgrade your Vienna database to make sure it contains the new Vienna website URL. Please note, 3.1.9 is the last main version that will work on Mac OS X 10.8\. Only simple bug-fixes will be made available for 10.8 users going forward.

The next main version of Vienna will be 3.2.0 and will require Mac OS X 10.9 and above.

Stay tuned!
